      <div class="content">When I was four, my mother bought me black, pink, and white clothes so I could dress myself. I spent most of my life thinking I had kinetic and sonic intelligence, but not visual intelligence.  I realized that's a myth and now I make web pages.  </div>

      <div class="title">CREATIVITY </div>
      <div class="content">A man and I once took his 10 year old sister to New York MoMA.  He turned his nose up at the minimalist exhibit and told the girl that it wasn't art.  I was mesmerized by a video of a woman lying on a spiral of slowly unraveling watermelons that floated in the Caspian Sea.  I told the man's sister that it's art if it does something to your brain.  I still believe that.</div>

      <div class="title">COLLABORATION</div>
      <div class="content">The best class I ever took was called Direction, Design, and Choreography at NYU.</div>
      <div class="content">We choreographers collaborated with set designers, lighting designers, costume designers, dancers, and composers.</div>
      <div class="content">Since then, I've collaborated with programmers, video artists, musicians, producers, sculptors, stylists, actors, directors, animators, and graphic designers.</div>

    <div class="box four">
      <div class="title">COMMUNITY</div>
      <div class="content">A wise man told me recently, when you say 'yes' to the world, the world says 'yes' to you.  I am dedicated to building one free webpage a month for artists and community organizations.  Ask to get on the calendar!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="box five">
      <div class="title">LEADERSHIP</div>
      <div class="content">The first time I led a group, I taught middle school kids how to build fires and shelters.</div>
      <div class="content">The second time, I led a summer dance program.</div>
      <div class="content">Nobody ever told me that leadership was supposed to be difficult.  </div>
      <div class="content">So I directed a dance company for four years.  This was easy, because dancers are disciplined.  It was hard because I tried to do too many things.  I learned to delegate.</div>
      <div class="content">When I decided to lead bands and record albums, I was surprised.  Musicians are not all disciplined.  I learned to read people and work with the best.  </div>
      <div class="content">Now I always work with the best.  Leadership is easy with great teams.</div>

      <div class="title">PROGRAMMING</div>
      <div class="content first">In high school, my father told me one day that he had decided what my college major was going to be.  My mother and I admonished him for deciding my future for me, but asked what it was.  He said software engineering.  </div>
      <div class="content">I rebelled against my Dad for years.  A couple years ago, I realized what a cool idea he had, and that he understood all those years ago how my brain works.  So I became a software engineer.</div>
